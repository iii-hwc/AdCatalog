                  outside an OpenGLView.
  4. ScrollView - a banner ad is docked to the top of the screen and sits
                  outside of a ScrollView.

  2. Game Levels - an interstitial is displayed before moving to level 2.
  3. Video Preroll - an interstitial is displayed prior to viewing a video.

- Support for tablets.

Requirements:
- Android SDK 3.2 or higher
- Google AdMob Ads SDK for Android
- AdMob publisher ID
- Eclipse (recommended)

Getting started with the Ad Catalog with Eclipse:
1. Create an Android project from existing source.
   - Create a new Android Project in Eclipse, and select "Create project from
     existing source."
   - Browse to the base directory of the source code.  The Project Name and
     Target name should be populated.  Click Finish.
2. Add the Google AdMob Ads Jar to your Eclipse Project.
   - Right click on your app project in Eclipse and select "Properties.
   - Select "Java Build Path" and the "Libraries" tab. Then click
     "Add External JARs..." to add the Google AdMob Ads Jar.
3. Add the android-support-v4.jar to your Eclipse Project.
   - The android-support-v4.jar is included in the Android Compatibility
     package.  For instructions on how to download this package, visit
     http://developer.android.com/sdk/compatibility-library.html#Downloading.
   - Include this jar the same way as the Google AdMob Ads jar.
4. Insert your AdMob publisher ID into the application.
   - In the admob_id string in res/values/strings.xml, replace the
     "INSERT_YOUR_ADMOB_ID_HERE" text with your publisher ID.

Your application should run properly.

Note:
- Test mode currently only gets test ads in the emulator.  To get test ads in
  test mode on your device, call adRequest.addTestDevice("YOUR_DEVICE_ID")
  method before calling the loadAd method.  Your device ID can be found in the
  LogCat output when loading an ad on your device.
